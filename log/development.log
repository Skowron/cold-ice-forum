This is no longer the\r\ncase since version 2 -- it now has its own API, but retains the old name. Yes,\r\nthat does mean that Redcarpet 2 is not backwards-compatible with the 1.X\r\nversions.\r\n\r\nRedcarpet is powered by the [Sundown](https://www.github.com/tanoku/sundown)\r\nlibrary. You might want to find out more about Sundown to see what makes this\r\nRuby library so awesome.\r\n\r\nThis library is written by people\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRedcarpet 2 has been rewritten from scratch by Vicent Martí (@tanoku). Why\r\nare you not following me on Twitter?\r\n\r\nRedcarpet would not be possible without the Sundown library and its authors\r\n(Natacha Porté, Vicent Martí, and its many awesome contributors).\r\n\r\nYou can totally install it as a Gem\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nRedcarpet is readily available as a Ruby gem. It will build some native\r\nextensions, but the parser is standalone and requires no installed libraries.\r\n\r\n    $ [sudo] gem install redcarpet\r\n\r\nThe Redcarpet source (including Sundown as a submodule) is available at GitHub:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet.git\r\n\r\nAnd it's like *really* simple to use\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe core of the Redcarpet library is the `Redcarpet::Markdown` class. Each\r\ninstance of the class is attached to a `Renderer` object; the Markdown class\r\nperforms parsing of a document and uses the attached renderer to generate\r\noutput.\r\n\r\nThe `Markdown` object is encouraged to be instantiated once with the required\r\nsettings, and reused between parses.\r\n\r\n    Markdown.new(renderer, extensions={})\r\n\r\n    Initializes a Markdown parser\r\n\r\n    renderer -  a renderer object, inheriting from Redcarpet::Render::Base.\r\n                If the given object has not been instantiated, the library\r\n                will do it with default arguments.\r\n\r\n    extensions - a hash containing the Markdown extensions which the parser\r\n                will identify. The following extensions are accepted:\r\n\r\n                :no_intra_emphasis - do not parse emphasis inside of words.\r\n                    Strings such as `foo_bar_baz` will not generate `<em>`\r\n                    tags.\r\n\r\n                :tables - parse tables, PHP-Markdown style\r\n\r\n                :fenced_code_blocks - parse fenced code blocks, PHP-Markdown\r\n                    style. Blocks delimited with 3 or more `~` or backticks\r\n                    will be considered as code, without the need to be\r\n                    indented.

These\r\nrenderers are actually implemented in C, and hence offer a brilliant\r\nperformance, several degrees of magnitude faster than other Ruby Markdown\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nAll the rendering flags that previously applied only to HTML output have\r\nnow been moved to the `Render::HTML` class, and may be enabled when\r\ninstantiating the renderer:\r\n\r\n    Render::HTML.new(render_options={})\r\n\r\nInitializes an HTML renderer. The following flags are available:\r\n\r\n    :filter_html - do not allow any user-inputted HTML in the output\r\n\r\n    :no_images - do not generate any `<img>` tags\r\n\r\n    :no_links - do not generate any `<a>` tags\r\n\r\n    :no_styles - do not generate any `<style>` tags\r\n\r\n    :safe_links_only - only generate links for protocols which are considered safe\r\n\r\n    :with_toc_data - add HTML anchors to each header in the output HTML,\r\n        to allow linking to each section.\r\n\r\n    :hard_wrap - insert HTML `<br>` tags inside on paragraphs where the origin\r\n        Markdown document had newlines (by default, Markdown ignores these\r\n        newlines).\r\n\r\n    :xhtml - output XHTML-conformant tags. This option is always enabled in the\r\n        `Render::XHTML` renderer.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    rndr = Redcarpet::Render::HTML.new(:no_links => true, :hard_wrap => true)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `HTML` renderer has an alternate version, `Redcarpet::Render::HTML_TOC`,\r\nwhich will output a table of contents in HTML based on the headers of the\r\nMarkdown document.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the abstract base class `Redcarpet::Render::Base` can be used\r\nto write a custom renderer purely in Ruby, or extending an existing renderer.\r\nSee the following section for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd you can even cook your own\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nCustom renderers are created by inheriting from an existing renderer.

You really want to mix Markdown renderers?\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhat a terrible idea! Markdown is already ill-specified enough; if you create\r\nsoftware that is renderer-independent, the results will be completely unreliable!\r\n\r\nEach renderer has its own API and its own set of extensions: you should choose one\r\n(it doesn't have to be Redcarpet, though that would be great!), write your\r\nsoftware accordingly, and force your users to install it. That's the\r\nonly way to have reliable and predictable Markdown output on your program.\r\n\r\nStill, if major forces (let's say, tornadoes or other natural disasters) force you\r\nto keep a Markdown-compatibility later, Redcarpet also supports this:\r\n\r\n    require 'redcarpet/compat'\r\n\r\nRequiring the compatibility library will declare a `Markdown` class with the\r\nclassical RedCloth API, e.g.\r\n\r\n    Markdown.new('this is my text').to_html\r\n\r\nThis class renders 100% standards compliant Markdown with 0 extensions. Nada.\r\nDon't even try to enable extensions with a compatibility layer, because\r\nthat's a maintance nightmare and won't work.\r\n\r\nOn a related topic: if your Markdown gem has a `lib/markdown.rb` file that\r\nmonkeypatches the Markdown class, you're a terrible human being.

This is no longer the\r\ncase since version 2 -- it now has its own API, but retains the old name. Yes,\r\nthat does mean that Redcarpet 2 is not backwards-compatible with the 1.X\r\nversions.\r\n\r\nRedcarpet is powered by the [Sundown](https://www.github.com/tanoku/sundown)\r\nlibrary. You might want to find out more about Sundown to see what makes this\r\nRuby library so awesome.\r\n\r\nThis library is written by people\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRedcarpet 2 has been rewritten from scratch by Vicent Martí (@tanoku). Why\r\nare you not following me on Twitter?\r\n\r\nRedcarpet would not be possible without the Sundown library and its authors\r\n(Natacha Porté, Vicent Martí, and its many awesome contributors).\r\n\r\nYou can totally install it as a Gem\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nRedcarpet is readily available as a Ruby gem. It will build some native\r\nextensions, but the parser is standalone and requires no installed libraries.\r\n\r\n    $ [sudo] gem install redcarpet\r\n\r\nThe Redcarpet source (including Sundown as a submodule) is available at GitHub:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet.git\r\n\r\nAnd it's like *really* simple to use\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe core of the Redcarpet library is the `Redcarpet::Markdown` class. Each\r\ninstance of the class is attached to a `Renderer` object; the Markdown class\r\nperforms parsing of a document and uses the attached renderer to generate\r\noutput.\r\n\r\nThe `Markdown` object is encouraged to be instantiated once with the required\r\nsettings, and reused between parses.\r\n\r\n    Markdown.new(renderer, extensions={})\r\n\r\n    Initializes a Markdown parser\r\n\r\n    renderer -  a renderer object, inheriting from Redcarpet::Render::Base.\r\n                If the given object has not been instantiated, the library\r\n                will do it with default arguments.\r\n\r\n    extensions - a hash containing the Markdown extensions which the parser\r\n                will identify. The following extensions are accepted:\r\n\r\n                :no_intra_emphasis - do not parse emphasis inside of words.\r\n                    Strings such as `foo_bar_baz` will not generate `<em>`\r\n                    tags.\r\n\r\n                :tables - parse tables, PHP-Markdown style\r\n\r\n                :fenced_code_blocks - parse fenced code blocks, PHP-Markdown\r\n                    style. Blocks delimited with 3 or more `~` or backticks\r\n                    will be considered as code, without the need to be\r\n                    indented. An optional language name may be added at the\r\n                    end of the opening fence for the code block\r\n\r\n                :autolink - parse links even when they are not enclosed in\r\n                    `<>` characters. Autolinks for the http, https and ftp\r\n                    protocols will be automatically detected.

Nada.\r\nDon't even try to enable extensions with a compatibility layer, because\r\nthat's a maintance nightmare and won't work.\r\n\r\nOn a related topic: if your Markdown gem has a `lib/markdown.rb` file that\r\nmonkeypatches the Markdown class, you're a terrible human being. Just saying.\r\n\r\nBoring legal stuff\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011, Vicent Martí\r\n\r\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\r\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\r\ncopyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\r\nWITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

The basic goal of SimpleForm is to not touch your way of defining the layout, letting\r\nyou find the better design for your eyes. Most of the DSL was inherited from Formtastic,\r\nwhich we are thankful for and should make you feel right at home.\r\n\r\nINFO: This README is [also available in a friendly navigable format](http://simple-form.plataformatec.com.br/)\r\nand refers to **SimpleForm** 2.0. If you are using **SimpleForm** in the versions 1.x, you should\r\ncheck this branch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form/tree/v1.5\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd it to your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n`gem 'simple_form'`\r\n\r\nRun the following command to install it:\r\n\r\n`bundle install`\r\n\r\nRun the generator:\r\n\r\n`rails generate simple_form:install`\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to use the country select, you will need the\r\n[country_select gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/country_select), add it to your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n`gem 'country_select'`\r\n\r\n### Twitter Bootstrap\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** 2.0 can be easily integrated to the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap).\r\nTo do that you have to use the `bootstrap` option in the install generator, like this:\r\n\r\n`rails generate simple_form:install --bootstrap`\r\n\r\nYou have to be sure that you added a copy of the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)\r\nassets on your application.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the generator output, our\r\n[example application code](https://github.com/rafaelfranca/simple_form-bootstrap) and\r\n[the live example app](http://simple-form-bootstrap.plataformatec.com.br/).\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: **SimpleForm** integration requires Twitter Bootstrap version 2.0 or higher.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** was designed to be customized as you need to. Basically it's a stack of components that\r\nare invoked to create a complete html input for you, which by default contains label, hints, errors\r\nand the input itself. It does not aim to create a lot of different logic from the default Rails\r\nform helpers, as they do a great work by themselves. Instead, **SimpleForm** acts as a DSL and just\r\nmaps your input type (retrieved from the column definition in the database) to an specific helper method.\r\n\r\nTo start using **SimpleForm** you just have to use the helper it provides:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate an entire form with labels for user name and password as well, and render errors\r\nby default when you render the form with invalid data (after submitting for example).\r\n\r\nYou can overwrite the default label by passing it to the input method. You can also add a hint or\r\neven a placeholder. For boolean inputs, you can add an inline label as well:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :label => 'Your username please' %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password, :hint => 'No special characters.' %>\r\n  <%= f.input :email, :placeholder => 'user@domain.com' %>\r\n  <%= f.input :remember_me, :inline_label => 'Yes, remember me'.html_safe %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some cases you may want to disable labels, hints or error. Or you may want to configure the html\r\nof any of them:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :label_html => { :class => 'my_class' } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password, :hint => false, :error_html => { :id => 'password_error'} %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password_confirmation, :label => false %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to pass any html attribute straight to the input, by using the `:input_html`\r\noption, for instance:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :input_html => { :class => 'special' } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password, :input_html => { :maxlength => 20 } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :remember_me, :input_html => { :value => '1' } %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to pass the same options to all inputs in the form (for example, a default class),\r\nyou can use the `:defaults` option in `simple_form_for`. Specific options in `input` call will\r\noverwrite the defaults:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user, :defaults => { :input_html => { :class => 'default_class' } } do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :input_html => { :class => 'special' } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password, :input_html => { :maxlength => 20 } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :remember_me, :input_html => { :value => '1' } %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince **SimpleForm** generates a wrapper div around your label and input by default, you can pass\r\nany html attribute to that wrapper as well using the `:wrapper_html` option, like so:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :wrapper_html => { :class => 'username' } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password, :wrapper_html => { :id => 'password' } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :remember_me, :wrapper_html => { :class => 'options' } %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default all inputs are required, which means an * is prepended to the label, but you can disable\r\nit in any input you want:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :name, :required => false %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also lets you overwrite the default input type it creates:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password %>\r\n  <%= f.input :description, :as => :text %>\r\n  <%= f.input :accepts,     :as => :radio_buttons %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo instead of a checkbox for the *accepts* attribute, you'll have a pair of radio buttons with yes/no\r\nlabels and a text area instead of a text field for the description. You can also render boolean\r\nattributes using `:as => :select` to show a dropdown.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to give the `:disabled` option to **SimpleForm**, and it'll automatically mark\r\nthe wrapper as disabled with a css class, so you can style labels, hints and other components inside\r\nthe wrapper as well:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :disabled => true, :hint => 'You cannot change your username.' %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** accepts same options as their corresponding input type helper in Rails:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :date_of_birth, :as => :date, :start_year => Date.today.year - 90,\r\n                              :end_year => Date.today.year - 12, :discard_day => true,\r\n                              :order => [:month, :year] %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also allows you to use label, hint, input_field, error and full_error helpers\r\n(please take a look at the rdocs for each method for more info):\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.label :username %>\r\n  <%= f.input_field :username %>\r\n  <%= f.hint 'No special characters, please!' %>\r\n  <%= f.error :username, :id => 'user_name_error' %>\r\n  <%= f.full_error :token %>\r\n  <%= f.submit 'Save' %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny extra option passed to these methods will be rendered as html option.\r\n\r\n### Collections\r\n\r\nAnd what if you want to create a select containing the age from 18 to 60 in your form? You can do it\r\noverriding the `:collection` option:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :user %>\r\n  <%= f.input :age, :collection => 18..60 %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCollections can be arrays or ranges, and when a `:collection` is given the `:select` input will be\r\nrendered by default, so we don't need to pass the `:as => :select` option. Other types of collection\r\nare `:radio_buttons` and `:check_boxes`. Those are added by **SimpleForm** to Rails set of form\r\nhelpers (read Extra Helpers session below for more information).\r\n\r\nCollection inputs accept two other options beside collections:\r\n\r\n* _label_method_ => the label method to be applied to the collection to retrieve the label (use this\r\n  instead of the `text_method` option in `collection_select`)\r\n\r\n* _value_method_ => the value method to be applied to the collection to retrieve the value\r\n\r\nThose methods are useful to manipulate the given collection. Both of these options also accept\r\nlambda/procs in case you want to calculate the value or label in a special way eg. custom\r\ntranslation. All other options given are sent straight to the underlying helper. For example, you\r\ncan give prompt as:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :age, :collection => 18..60, :prompt => \"Select your age\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to create grouped collection selects, that will use the html *optgroup* tags, like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :country_id, :collection => @continents, :as => :grouped_select, :group_method => :countries\r\n```\r\n\r\nGrouped collection inputs accept the same `:label_method` and `:value_method` options, which will be\r\nused to retrieve label/value attributes for the `option` tags. Besides that, you can give:\r\n\r\n* _group_method_ => the method to be called on the given collection to generate the options for\r\n  each group (required)\r\n\r\n* _group_label_method_ => the label method to be applied on the given collection to retrieve the label\r\n  for the _optgroup_ (**SimpleForm** will attempt to guess the best one the same way it does with\r\n  `:label_method`)\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also supports `:time_zone` and `:country`. When using such helpers, you can give\r\n`:priority` as option to select which time zones and/or countries should be given higher priority:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :residence_country, :priority => [ \"Brazil\" ]\r\nf.input :time_zone, :priority => /US/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThose values can also be configured with a default value to be used site use through the\r\n`SimpleForm.country_priority` and `SimpleForm.time_zone_priority` helpers.\r\n\r\nNote: While using `country_select` if you want to restrict to only a subset of countries for a specific\r\ndrop down then you may use the `:collection` option:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :shipping_country, :priority => [ \"Brazil\" ], :collection => [ \"Australia\", \"Brazil\", \"New Zealand\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Associations\r\n\r\nTo deal with associations, **SimpleForm** can generate select inputs, a series of radios buttons or check boxes.\r\nLets see how it works: imagine you have a user model that belongs to a company and has_and_belongs_to_many\r\nroles. The structure would be something like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :company\r\n  has_and_belongs_to_many :roles\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Company < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :users\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Role < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_and_belongs_to_many :users\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we have the user form:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :name %>\r\n  <%= f.association :company %>\r\n  <%= f.association :roles %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimple enough, right? This is going to render a `:select` input for choosing the `:company`, and another\r\n`:select` input with `:multiple` option for the `:roles`. You can, of course, change it to use radio\r\nbuttons and check boxes as well:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.association :company, :as => :radio_buttons\r\nf.association :roles,   :as => :check_boxes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe association helper just invokes `input` under the hood, so all options available to `:select`,\r\n`:radio_buttons` and `:check_boxes` are also available to association. Additionally, you can specify\r\nthe collection by hand, all together with the prompt:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.association :company, :collection => Company.active.all(:order => 'name'), :prompt => \"Choose a Company\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Buttons\r\n\r\nAll web forms need buttons, right? **SimpleForm** wraps them in the DSL, acting like a proxy:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :name %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above will simply call submit. You choose to use it or not, it's just a question of taste.\r\n\r\n### Wrapping Rails Form Helpers\r\n\r\nSay you wanted to use a rails form helper but still wrap it in **SimpleForm** goodness? You can, by\r\ncalling input with a block like so:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= f.input :role do %>\r\n  <%= f.select :role, Role.all.map { |r| [r.name, r.id, { :class => r.company.id }] }, :include_blank => true %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, we're taking advantage of Rails 3's select method that allows us to pass in a\r\nhash of additional attributes for each option.\r\n\r\n### Extra helpers\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also comes with some extra helpers you can use inside rails default forms without relying\r\non `simple_form_for` helper. They are listed below.\r\n\r\n#### Simple Fields For\r\n\r\nWrapper to use **SimpleForm** inside a default rails form. It works in the same way that the `field_for`\r\nRails helper, but change the builder to use the `SimpleForm::FormBuilder`.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nform_for @user do |f|\r\n  f.simple_fields_for :posts do |posts_form|\r\n    # Here you have all simple_form methods available\r\n    posts_form.input :title\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Collection Radio Buttons\r\n\r\nCreates a collection of radio inputs with labels associated (same API as `collection_select`):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nform_for @user do |f|\r\n  f.collection_radio_buttons :options, [[true, 'Yes'] ,[false, 'No']], :first, :last\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input id=\"user_options_true\" name=\"user[options]\" type=\"radio\" value=\"true\" />\r\n<label class=\"collection_radio_buttons\" for=\"user_options_true\">Yes</label>\r\n<input id=\"user_options_false\" name=\"user[options]\" type=\"radio\" value=\"false\" />\r\n<label class=\"collection_radio_buttons\" for=\"user_options_false\">No</label>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Collection Check Boxes\r\n\r\nCreates a collection of check boxes with labels associated (same API as `collection_select`):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nform_for @user do |f|\r\n  f.collection_check_boxes :options, [[true, 'Yes'] ,[false, 'No']], :first, :last\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input name=\"user[options][]\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\" />\r\n<input id=\"user_options_true\" name=\"user[options][]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"true\" />\r\n<label class=\"collection_check_box\" for=\"user_options_true\">Yes</label>\r\n<input name=\"user[options][]\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\" />\r\n<input id=\"user_options_false\" name=\"user[options][]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"false\" />\r\n<label class=\"collection_check_box\" for=\"user_options_false\">No</label>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use this with associations in your model, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nform_for @user do |f|\r\n  f.collection_check_boxes :role_ids, Role.all, :id, :name # using :roles here is not going to work.\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Mappings/Inputs available\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** comes with a lot of default mappings:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nMapping               Input                         Column Type\r\n\r\nboolean               check box                     boolean\r\nstring                text field                    string\r\nemail                 email field                   string with name matching \"email\"\r\nurl                   url field                     string with name matching \"url\"\r\ntel                   tel field                     string with name matching \"phone\"\r\npassword              password field                string with name matching \"password\"\r\nsearch                search                        -\r\ntext                  text area                     text\r\nfile                  file field                    string, responding to file methods\r\nhidden                hidden field                  -\r\ninteger               number field                  integer\r\nfloat                 number field                  float\r\ndecimal               number field                  decimal\r\nrange                 range field                   -\r\ndatetime              datetime select               datetime/timestamp\r\ndate                  date select                   date\r\ntime                  time select                   time\r\nselect                collection select             belongs_to/has_many/has_and_belongs_to_many associations\r\nradio_buttons         collection radio buttons      belongs_to\r\ncheck_boxes           collection check boxes        has_many/has_and_belongs_to_many associations\r\ncountry               country select                string with name matching \"country\"\r\ntime_zone             time zone select              string with name matching \"time_zone\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Custom inputs\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to add custom inputs to **SimpleForm**. For instance, if you want to add a custom input\r\nthat extends the string one, you just need to add this file:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/inputs/currency_input.rb\r\nclass CurrencyInput < SimpleForm::Inputs::Base\r\n  def input\r\n    \"$ \#{@builder.text_field(attribute_name, input_html_options)}\".html_safe\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use it in your views:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :money, :as => :currency\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also redefine existing **SimpleForm** inputs by creating a new class with the same name. For\r\ninstance, if you want to wrap date/time/datetime in a div, you can do:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/inputs/date_time_input.rb\r\nclass DateTimeInput < SimpleForm::Inputs::DateTimeInput\r\n  def input\r\n    \"<div>\#{super}</div>\".html_safe\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr if you want to add a class to all the select fields you can do:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/inputs/collection_select_input.rb\r\nclass CollectionSelectInput < SimpleForm::Inputs::CollectionSelectInput\r\n  def input_html_classes\r\n    super.push('chosen')\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Custom form builder\r\n\r\nYou can create a custom form builder that uses **SimpleForm**.\r\n\r\nCreate a helper method that calls `simple_form_for` with a custom builder:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef custom_form_for(object, *args, &block)\r\n  options = args.extract_options!\r\n  simple_form_for(object, *(args << options.merge(:builder => CustomFormBuilder)), &block)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a form builder class that inherits from `SimpleForm::FormBuilder`.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass CustomFormBuilder < SimpleForm::FormBuilder\r\n  def input(attribute_name, options = {}, &block)\r\n    options[:input_html].merge! :class => 'custom'\r\n    super\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## I18n\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** uses all power of I18n API to lookup labels, hints and placeholders. To customize your\r\nforms you can create a locale file like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  simple_form:\r\n    labels:\r\n      user:\r\n        username: 'User name'\r\n        password: 'Password'\r\n    hints:\r\n      user:\r\n        username: 'User name to sign in.'\r\n        password: 'No special characters, please.'\r\n    placeholders:\r\n      user:\r\n        username: 'Your username'\r\n        password: '****'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd your forms will use this information to render the components for you.\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also lets you be more specific, separating lookups through actions for labels, hints and\r\nplaceholders. Let's say you want a different label for new and edit actions, the locale file would\r\nbe something like:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  simple_form:\r\n    labels:\r\n      user:\r\n        username: 'User name'\r\n        password: 'Password'\r\n        edit:\r\n          username: 'Change user name'\r\n          password: 'Change password'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way **SimpleForm** will figure out the right translation for you, based on the action being\r\nrendered. And to be a little bit DRYer with your locale file, you can specify defaults for all\r\nmodels under the 'defaults' key:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  simple_form:\r\n    labels:\r\n      defaults:\r\n        username: 'User name'\r\n        password: 'Password'\r\n        new:\r\n          username: 'Choose a user name'\r\n    hints:\r\n      defaults:\r\n        username: 'User name to sign in.'\r\n        password: 'No special characters, please.'\r\n    placeholders:\r\n      defaults:\r\n        username: 'Your username'\r\n        password: '****'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** will always look for a default attribute translation under the \"defaults\" key if no\r\nspecific is found inside the model key. Note that this syntax is different from 1.x. To migrate to\r\nthe new syntax, just move \"labels.\#{attribute}\" to \"labels.defaults.\#{attribute}\".\r\n\r\nIn addition, **SimpleForm** will fallback to default human_attribute_name from Rails when no other\r\ntranslation is found for labels. Finally, you can also overwrite any label, hint or placeholder\r\ninside your view, just by passing the option manually. This way the I18n lookup will be skipped.\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also has support for translating options in collection helpers. For instance, given a\r\nUser with a `:gender` attribute, you might want to create a select box showing translated labels\r\nthat would post either `male` or `female` as value. With **SimpleForm** you could create an input\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :gender, :collection => [:male, :female]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd **SimpleForm** will try a lookup like this in your locale file, to find the right labels to show:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  simple_form:\r\n    options:\r\n      user:\r\n        gender:\r\n          male: 'Male'\r\n          female: \"Female'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use the `defaults` key as you would do with labels, hints and placeholders. It is\r\nimportant to notice that **SimpleForm** will only do the lookup for options if you give a collection\r\ncomposed of symbols only. This is to avoid constant lookups to I18n.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to translate buttons, using Rails' built-in I18n support:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  helpers:\r\n    submit:\r\n      user:\r\n        create: \"Add %{model}\"\r\n        update: \"Save Changes\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are other options that can be configured through I18n API, such as required text and boolean.\r\nBe sure to check our locale file or the one copied to your application after you run\r\n`rails generate simple_form:install`.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that translations for labels, hints and placeholders for a namespaced model, e.g.\r\n`Admin::User`, should be placed under `admin_user`, not under `admin/user`. This is different from\r\nhow translations for namespaced model and attribute names are defined:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  activerecord:\r\n    models:\r\n        admin/user: User\r\n    attributes:\r\n        admin/user:\r\n            name: Name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThey should be placed under `admin/user`. Form labels, hints and placeholders for those attributes,\r\nthough, should be placed under `admin_user`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  simple_form:\r\n    labels:\r\n        admin_user:\r\n            name: Name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis difference exists because **SimpleForm** relies on `object_name` provided by Rails'\r\nFormBuilder to determine the translation path for a given object instead of `i18n_key` from the\r\nobject itself. Thus, similarly, if a form for an `Admin::User` object is defined by calling\r\n`simple_form_for @admin_user, :as => :some_user`, **SimpleForm** will look for translations\r\nunder `some_user` instead of `admin_user`.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** has several configuration options. You can read and change them in the initializer\r\ncreated by **SimpleForm**, so if you haven't executed the command below yet, please do:\r\n\r\n`rails generate simple_form:install`\r\n\r\n### The wrappers API\r\n\r\nWith **SimpleForm** you can configure how your components will be rendered using the wrappers API.\r\nThe syntax looks like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.wrappers :tag => :div, :class => :input,\r\n                :error_class => :field_with_errors do |b|\r\n\r\n  # Form extensions\r\n  b.use :html5\r\n  b.optional :pattern\r\n  b.use :maxlength\r\n  b.use :placeholder\r\n  b.use :readonly\r\n\r\n  # Form components\r\n  b.use :label_input\r\n  b.use :hint,  :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :hint }\r\n  b.use :error, :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :error }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe _Form components_ will generate the form tags like labels, inputs, hints or errors contents. The available components are:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n:label         # The <label> tag alone\r\n:input         # The <input> tag alone\r\n:label_input   # The <label> and the <input> tags\r\n:hint          # The hint for the input\r\n:error         # The error for the input\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe _Form extensions_ are used to generate some attributes or perform some lookups on the model to\r\nadd extra information to your components.\r\n\r\nYou can create new _Form components_ using the wrappers API as in the following example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.wrappers do |b|\r\n  b.use :placeholder\r\n  b.use :label_input\r\n  b.wrapper :tag => :div, :class => 'separator' do |component|\r\n    component.use :hint,  :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :hint }\r\n    component.use :error, :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :error }\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis will wrap the hint and error components within a `div` tag using the class `'separator'`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to customize the custom _Form components_ on demand you can give it a name like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.wrappers do |b|\r\n  b.use :placeholder\r\n  b.use :label_input\r\n  b.wrapper :my_wrapper, :tag => :div, :class => 'separator' do |component|\r\n    component.use :hint,  :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :hint }\r\n    component.use :error, :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :error }\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nand now you can pass options to your `input` calls to customize the `:my_wrapper` _Form component_.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Completely turns off the custom wrapper\r\nf.input :name, :my_wrapper => false\r\n\r\n# Configure the html\r\nf.input :name, :my_wrapper_html => { :id => 'special_id' }\r\n\r\n# Configure the tag\r\nf.input :name, :my_wrapper_tag => :p\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also define more than one wrapper and pick one to render in a specific form or input.\r\nTo define another wrapper you have to give it a name, as the follow:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.wrappers :small do |b|\r\n  b.use :placeholder\r\n  b.use :label_input\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nand use it in this way:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Specifying to whole form\r\nsimple_form_for @user, :wrapper => :small do |f|\r\n  f.input :name\r\nend\r\n\r\n# Specifying to one input\r\nsimple_form_for @user do |f|\r\n  f.input :name, :wrapper => :small\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also allows you to use optional elements. For instance, let's suppose you want to use\r\nhints or placeholders, but you don't want them to be generated automatically. You can set their\r\ndefault values to `false` or use the `optional` method. Is preferible to use the `optional` syntax:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.wrappers :placeholder => false do |b|\r\n  b.use :placeholder\r\n  b.use :label_input\r\n  b.wrapper :tag => :div, :class => 'separator' do |component|\r\n    component.optional :hint, :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :hint }\r\n    component.use :error, :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :error }\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy setting it as `optional`, a hint will only be generated when `:hint => true` is explicitly used.\r\nThe same for placehold.\r\n\r\n## HTML 5 Notice\r\n\r\nBy default, **SimpleForm** will generate input field types and attributes that are supported in HTML5,\r\nbut are considered invalid HTML for older document types such as HTML4 or XHTML1.0. The HTML5\r\nextensions include the new field types such as email, number, search, url, tel, and the new\r\nattributes such as required, autofocus, maxlength, min, max, step.\r\n\r\nMost browsers will not care, but some of the newer ones - in particular Chrome 10+ - use the\r\nrequired attribute to force a value into an input and will prevent form submission without it.\r\nDepending on the design of the application this may or may not be desired. In many cases it can\r\nbreak existing UI's.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to disable all HTML 5 extensions in **SimpleForm** with the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nSimpleForm.html5 = false # default is true\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to have all other HTML 5 features, such as the new field types, you can disable only\r\nthe browser validation:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nSimpleForm.browser_validations = false # default is true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis option adds a new `novalidate` property to the form, instructing it to skip all HTML 5\r\nvalidation. The inputs will still be generated with the required and other attributes, that might\r\nhelp you to use some generic javascript validation.\r\n\r\nYou can also add `novalidate` to a specific form by setting the option on the form itself:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for(resource, :html => {:novalidate => true}) do |form| %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease notice that any of the configurations above will disable the `placeholder` component,\r\nwhich is an HTML 5 feature. We believe most of the newest browsers are handling this attribute fine,\r\nand if they aren't, any plugin you use would take of using the placeholder attribute to do it.\r\nHowever, you can disable it if you want, by removing the placeholder component from the components\r\nlist in **SimpleForm** configuration file.\r\n\r\n## Information\r\n\r\n### Google Group\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, comments, or concerns please use the Google Group instead of the GitHub\r\nIssues tracker:\r\n\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/plataformatec-simpleform\r\n\r\n### RDocs\r\n\r\nYou can view the **SimpleForm** documentation in RDoc format here:\r\n\r\nhttp://rubydoc.info/github/plataformatec/simple_form/master/frames\r\n\r\nIf you need to use **SimpleForm** with Rails 2.3, you can always run `gem server` from the command line\r\nafter you install the gem to access the old documentation.\r\n\r\n### Bug reports\r\n\r\nIf you discover any bugs, feel free to create an issue on GitHub.

The basic goal of SimpleForm is to not touch your way of defining the layout, letting\r\nyou find the better design for your eyes. Most of the DSL was inherited from Formtastic,\r\nwhich we are thankful for and should make you feel right at home.\r\n\r\nINFO: This README is [also available in a friendly navigable format](http://simple-form.plataformatec.com.br/)\r\nand refers to **SimpleForm** 2.0. If you are using **SimpleForm** in the versions 1.x, you should\r\ncheck this branch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form/tree/v1.5\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd it to your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n`gem 'simple_form'`\r\n\r\nRun the following command to install it:\r\n\r\n`bundle install`\r\n\r\nRun the generator:\r\n\r\n`rails generate simple_form:install`\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to use the country select, you will need the\r\n[country_select gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/country_select), add it to your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n`gem 'country_select'`\r\n\r\n### Twitter Bootstrap\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** 2.0 can be easily integrated to the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap).\r\nTo do that you have to use the `bootstrap` option in the install generator, like this:\r\n\r\n`rails generate simple_form:install --bootstrap`\r\n\r\nYou have to be sure that you added a copy of the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)\r\nassets on your application.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the generator output, our\r\n[example application code](https://github.com/rafaelfranca/simple_form-bootstrap) and\r\n[the live example app](http://simple-form-bootstrap.plataformatec.com.br/).\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: **SimpleForm** integration requires Twitter Bootstrap version 2.0 or higher.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** was designed to be customized as you need to. Basically it's a stack of components that\r\nare invoked to create a complete html input for you, which by default contains label, hints, errors\r\nand the input itself. It does not aim to create a lot of different logic from the default Rails\r\nform helpers, as they do a great work by themselves. Instead, **SimpleForm** acts as a DSL and just\r\nmaps your input type (retrieved from the column definition in the database) to an specific helper method.\r\n\r\nTo start using **SimpleForm** you just have to use the helper it provides:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate an entire form with labels for user name and password as well, and render errors\r\nby default when you render the form with invalid data (after submitting for example).\r\n\r\nYou can overwrite the default label by passing it to the input method. You can also add a hint or\r\neven a placeholder. For boolean inputs, you can add an inline label as well:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :label => 'Your username please' %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password, :hint => 'No special characters.' %>\r\n  <%= f.input :email, :placeholder => 'user@domain.com' %>\r\n  <%= f.input :remember_me, :inline_label => 'Yes, remember me'.html_safe %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some cases you may want to disable labels, hints or error. Or you may want to configure the html\r\nof any of them:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :label_html => { :class => 'my_class' } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password, :hint => false, :error_html => { :id => 'password_error'} %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password_confirmation, :label => false %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to pass any html attribute straight to the input, by using the `:input_html`\r\noption, for instance:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :input_html => { :class => 'special' } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password, :input_html => { :maxlength => 20 } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :remember_me, :input_html => { :value => '1' } %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to pass the same options to all inputs in the form (for example, a default class),\r\nyou can use the `:defaults` option in `simple_form_for`. Specific options in `input` call will\r\noverwrite the defaults:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user, :defaults => { :input_html => { :class => 'default_class' } } do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :input_html => { :class => 'special' } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password, :input_html => { :maxlength => 20 } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :remember_me, :input_html => { :value => '1' } %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince **SimpleForm** generates a wrapper div around your label and input by default, you can pass\r\nany html attribute to that wrapper as well using the `:wrapper_html` option, like so:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :wrapper_html => { :class => 'username' } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password, :wrapper_html => { :id => 'password' } %>\r\n  <%= f.input :remember_me, :wrapper_html => { :class => 'options' } %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default all inputs are required, which means an * is prepended to the label, but you can disable\r\nit in any input you want:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :name, :required => false %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also lets you overwrite the default input type it creates:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username %>\r\n  <%= f.input :password %>\r\n  <%= f.input :description, :as => :text %>\r\n  <%= f.input :accepts,     :as => :radio_buttons %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo instead of a checkbox for the *accepts* attribute, you'll have a pair of radio buttons with yes/no\r\nlabels and a text area instead of a text field for the description. You can also render boolean\r\nattributes using `:as => :select` to show a dropdown.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to give the `:disabled` option to **SimpleForm**, and it'll automatically mark\r\nthe wrapper as disabled with a css class, so you can style labels, hints and other components inside\r\nthe wrapper as well:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :username, :disabled => true, :hint => 'You cannot change your username.' %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** accepts same options as their corresponding input type helper in Rails:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :date_of_birth, :as => :date, :start_year => Date.today.year - 90,\r\n                              :end_year => Date.today.year - 12, :discard_day => true,\r\n                              :order => [:month, :year] %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also allows you to use label, hint, input_field, error and full_error helpers\r\n(please take a look at the rdocs for each method for more info):\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.label :username %>\r\n  <%= f.input_field :username %>\r\n  <%= f.hint 'No special characters, please!' %>\r\n  <%= f.error :username, :id => 'user_name_error' %>\r\n  <%= f.full_error :token %>\r\n  <%= f.submit 'Save' %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny extra option passed to these methods will be rendered as html option.\r\n\r\n### Collections\r\n\r\nAnd what if you want to create a select containing the age from 18 to 60 in your form? You can do it\r\noverriding the `:collection` option:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :user %>\r\n  <%= f.input :age, :collection => 18..60 %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCollections can be arrays or ranges, and when a `:collection` is given the `:select` input will be\r\nrendered by default, so we don't need to pass the `:as => :select` option. Other types of collection\r\nare `:radio_buttons` and `:check_boxes`. Those are added by **SimpleForm** to Rails set of form\r\nhelpers (read Extra Helpers session below for more information).\r\n\r\nCollection inputs accept two other options beside collections:\r\n\r\n* _label_method_ => the label method to be applied to the collection to retrieve the label (use this\r\n  instead of the `text_method` option in `collection_select`)\r\n\r\n* _value_method_ => the value method to be applied to the collection to retrieve the value\r\n\r\nThose methods are useful to manipulate the given collection. Both of these options also accept\r\nlambda/procs in case you want to calculate the value or label in a special way eg. custom\r\ntranslation. All other options given are sent straight to the underlying helper. For example, you\r\ncan give prompt as:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :age, :collection => 18..60, :prompt => \"Select your age\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to create grouped collection selects, that will use the html *optgroup* tags, like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :country_id, :collection => @continents, :as => :grouped_select, :group_method => :countries\r\n```\r\n\r\nGrouped collection inputs accept the same `:label_method` and `:value_method` options, which will be\r\nused to retrieve label/value attributes for the `option` tags. Besides that, you can give:\r\n\r\n* _group_method_ => the method to be called on the given collection to generate the options for\r\n  each group (required)\r\n\r\n* _group_label_method_ => the label method to be applied on the given collection to retrieve the label\r\n  for the _optgroup_ (**SimpleForm** will attempt to guess the best one the same way it does with\r\n  `:label_method`)\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also supports `:time_zone` and `:country`. When using such helpers, you can give\r\n`:priority` as option to select which time zones and/or countries should be given higher priority:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :residence_country, :priority => [ \"Brazil\" ]\r\nf.input :time_zone, :priority => /US/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThose values can also be configured with a default value to be used site use through the\r\n`SimpleForm.country_priority` and `SimpleForm.time_zone_priority` helpers.\r\n\r\nNote: While using `country_select` if you want to restrict to only a subset of countries for a specific\r\ndrop down then you may use the `:collection` option:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :shipping_country, :priority => [ \"Brazil\" ], :collection => [ \"Australia\", \"Brazil\", \"New Zealand\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Associations\r\n\r\nTo deal with associations, **SimpleForm** can generate select inputs, a series of radios buttons or check boxes.\r\nLets see how it works: imagine you have a user model that belongs to a company and has_and_belongs_to_many\r\nroles. The structure would be something like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :company\r\n  has_and_belongs_to_many :roles\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Company < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :users\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Role < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_and_belongs_to_many :users\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we have the user form:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :name %>\r\n  <%= f.association :company %>\r\n  <%= f.association :roles %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimple enough, right? This is going to render a `:select` input for choosing the `:company`, and another\r\n`:select` input with `:multiple` option for the `:roles`. You can, of course, change it to use radio\r\nbuttons and check boxes as well:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.association :company, :as => :radio_buttons\r\nf.association :roles,   :as => :check_boxes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe association helper just invokes `input` under the hood, so all options available to `:select`,\r\n`:radio_buttons` and `:check_boxes` are also available to association. Additionally, you can specify\r\nthe collection by hand, all together with the prompt:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.association :company, :collection => Company.active.all(:order => 'name'), :prompt => \"Choose a Company\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Buttons\r\n\r\nAll web forms need buttons, right? **SimpleForm** wraps them in the DSL, acting like a proxy:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>\r\n  <%= f.input :name %>\r\n  <%= f.button :submit %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above will simply call submit. You choose to use it or not, it's just a question of taste.\r\n\r\n### Wrapping Rails Form Helpers\r\n\r\nSay you wanted to use a rails form helper but still wrap it in **SimpleForm** goodness? You can, by\r\ncalling input with a block like so:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= f.input :role do %>\r\n  <%= f.select :role, Role.all.map { |r| [r.name, r.id, { :class => r.company.id }] }, :include_blank => true %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, we're taking advantage of Rails 3's select method that allows us to pass in a\r\nhash of additional attributes for each option.\r\n\r\n### Extra helpers\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also comes with some extra helpers you can use inside rails default forms without relying\r\non `simple_form_for` helper. They are listed below.\r\n\r\n#### Simple Fields For\r\n\r\nWrapper to use **SimpleForm** inside a default rails form. It works in the same way that the `field_for`\r\nRails helper, but change the builder to use the `SimpleForm::FormBuilder`.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nform_for @user do |f|\r\n  f.simple_fields_for :posts do |posts_form|\r\n    # Here you have all simple_form methods available\r\n    posts_form.input :title\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Collection Radio Buttons\r\n\r\nCreates a collection of radio inputs with labels associated (same API as `collection_select`):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nform_for @user do |f|\r\n  f.collection_radio_buttons :options, [[true, 'Yes'] ,[false, 'No']], :first, :last\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input id=\"user_options_true\" name=\"user[options]\" type=\"radio\" value=\"true\" />\r\n<label class=\"collection_radio_buttons\" for=\"user_options_true\">Yes</label>\r\n<input id=\"user_options_false\" name=\"user[options]\" type=\"radio\" value=\"false\" />\r\n<label class=\"collection_radio_buttons\" for=\"user_options_false\">No</label>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Collection Check Boxes\r\n\r\nCreates a collection of check boxes with labels associated (same API as `collection_select`):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nform_for @user do |f|\r\n  f.collection_check_boxes :options, [[true, 'Yes'] ,[false, 'No']], :first, :last\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input name=\"user[options][]\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\" />\r\n<input id=\"user_options_true\" name=\"user[options][]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"true\" />\r\n<label class=\"collection_check_box\" for=\"user_options_true\">Yes</label>\r\n<input name=\"user[options][]\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\" />\r\n<input id=\"user_options_false\" name=\"user[options][]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"false\" />\r\n<label class=\"collection_check_box\" for=\"user_options_false\">No</label>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use this with associations in your model, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nform_for @user do |f|\r\n  f.collection_check_boxes :role_ids, Role.all, :id, :name # using :roles here is not going to work.\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Mappings/Inputs available\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** comes with a lot of default mappings:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nMapping               Input                         Column Type\r\n\r\nboolean               check box                     boolean\r\nstring                text field                    string\r\nemail                 email field                   string with name matching \"email\"\r\nurl                   url field                     string with name matching \"url\"\r\ntel                   tel field                     string with name matching \"phone\"\r\npassword              password field                string with name matching \"password\"\r\nsearch                search                        -\r\ntext                  text area                     text\r\nfile                  file field                    string, responding to file methods\r\nhidden                hidden field                  -\r\ninteger               number field                  integer\r\nfloat                 number field                  float\r\ndecimal               number field                  decimal\r\nrange                 range field                   -\r\ndatetime              datetime select               datetime/timestamp\r\ndate                  date select                   date\r\ntime                  time select                   time\r\nselect                collection select             belongs_to/has_many/has_and_belongs_to_many associations\r\nradio_buttons         collection radio buttons      belongs_to\r\ncheck_boxes           collection check boxes        has_many/has_and_belongs_to_many associations\r\ncountry               country select                string with name matching \"country\"\r\ntime_zone             time zone select              string with name matching \"time_zone\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Custom inputs\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to add custom inputs to **SimpleForm**. For instance, if you want to add a custom input\r\nthat extends the string one, you just need to add this file:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/inputs/currency_input.rb\r\nclass CurrencyInput < SimpleForm::Inputs::Base\r\n  def input\r\n    \"$ \#{@builder.text_field(attribute_name, input_html_options)}\".html_safe\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use it in your views:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :money, :as => :currency\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also redefine existing **SimpleForm** inputs by creating a new class with the same name. For\r\ninstance, if you want to wrap date/time/datetime in a div, you can do:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/inputs/date_time_input.rb\r\nclass DateTimeInput < SimpleForm::Inputs::DateTimeInput\r\n  def input\r\n    \"<div>\#{super}</div>\".html_safe\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr if you want to add a class to all the select fields you can do:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/inputs/collection_select_input.rb\r\nclass CollectionSelectInput < SimpleForm::Inputs::CollectionSelectInput\r\n  def input_html_classes\r\n    super.push('chosen')\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Custom form builder\r\n\r\nYou can create a custom form builder that uses **SimpleForm**.\r\n\r\nCreate a helper method that calls `simple_form_for` with a custom builder:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef custom_form_for(object, *args, &block)\r\n  options = args.extract_options!\r\n  simple_form_for(object, *(args << options.merge(:builder => CustomFormBuilder)), &block)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a form builder class that inherits from `SimpleForm::FormBuilder`.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass CustomFormBuilder < SimpleForm::FormBuilder\r\n  def input(attribute_name, options = {}, &block)\r\n    options[:input_html].merge! :class => 'custom'\r\n    super\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## I18n\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** uses all power of I18n API to lookup labels, hints and placeholders. To customize your\r\nforms you can create a locale file like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  simple_form:\r\n    labels:\r\n      user:\r\n        username: 'User name'\r\n        password: 'Password'\r\n    hints:\r\n      user:\r\n        username: 'User name to sign in.'\r\n        password: 'No special characters, please.'\r\n    placeholders:\r\n      user:\r\n        username: 'Your username'\r\n        password: '****'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd your forms will use this information to render the components for you.\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also lets you be more specific, separating lookups through actions for labels, hints and\r\nplaceholders. Let's say you want a different label for new and edit actions, the locale file would\r\nbe something like:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  simple_form:\r\n    labels:\r\n      user:\r\n        username: 'User name'\r\n        password: 'Password'\r\n        edit:\r\n          username: 'Change user name'\r\n          password: 'Change password'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way **SimpleForm** will figure out the right translation for you, based on the action being\r\nrendered. And to be a little bit DRYer with your locale file, you can specify defaults for all\r\nmodels under the 'defaults' key:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  simple_form:\r\n    labels:\r\n      defaults:\r\n        username: 'User name'\r\n        password: 'Password'\r\n        new:\r\n          username: 'Choose a user name'\r\n    hints:\r\n      defaults:\r\n        username: 'User name to sign in.'\r\n        password: 'No special characters, please.'\r\n    placeholders:\r\n      defaults:\r\n        username: 'Your username'\r\n        password: '****'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** will always look for a default attribute translation under the \"defaults\" key if no\r\nspecific is found inside the model key. Note that this syntax is different from 1.x. To migrate to\r\nthe new syntax, just move \"labels.\#{attribute}\" to \"labels.defaults.\#{attribute}\".\r\n\r\nIn addition, **SimpleForm** will fallback to default human_attribute_name from Rails when no other\r\ntranslation is found for labels. Finally, you can also overwrite any label, hint or placeholder\r\ninside your view, just by passing the option manually. This way the I18n lookup will be skipped.\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also has support for translating options in collection helpers. For instance, given a\r\nUser with a `:gender` attribute, you might want to create a select box showing translated labels\r\nthat would post either `male` or `female` as value. With **SimpleForm** you could create an input\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf.input :gender, :collection => [:male, :female]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd **SimpleForm** will try a lookup like this in your locale file, to find the right labels to show:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  simple_form:\r\n    options:\r\n      user:\r\n        gender:\r\n          male: 'Male'\r\n          female: \"Female'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use the `defaults` key as you would do with labels, hints and placeholders. It is\r\nimportant to notice that **SimpleForm** will only do the lookup for options if you give a collection\r\ncomposed of symbols only. This is to avoid constant lookups to I18n.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to translate buttons, using Rails' built-in I18n support:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  helpers:\r\n    submit:\r\n      user:\r\n        create: \"Add %{model}\"\r\n        update: \"Save Changes\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are other options that can be configured through I18n API, such as required text and boolean.\r\nBe sure to check our locale file or the one copied to your application after you run\r\n`rails generate simple_form:install`.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that translations for labels, hints and placeholders for a namespaced model, e.g.\r\n`Admin::User`, should be placed under `admin_user`, not under `admin/user`. This is different from\r\nhow translations for namespaced model and attribute names are defined:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  activerecord:\r\n    models:\r\n        admin/user: User\r\n    attributes:\r\n        admin/user:\r\n            name: Name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThey should be placed under `admin/user`. Form labels, hints and placeholders for those attributes,\r\nthough, should be placed under `admin_user`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nen:\r\n  simple_form:\r\n    labels:\r\n        admin_user:\r\n            name: Name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis difference exists because **SimpleForm** relies on `object_name` provided by Rails'\r\nFormBuilder to determine the translation path for a given object instead of `i18n_key` from the\r\nobject itself. Thus, similarly, if a form for an `Admin::User` object is defined by calling\r\n`simple_form_for @admin_user, :as => :some_user`, **SimpleForm** will look for translations\r\nunder `some_user` instead of `admin_user`.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** has several configuration options. You can read and change them in the initializer\r\ncreated by **SimpleForm**, so if you haven't executed the command below yet, please do:\r\n\r\n`rails generate simple_form:install`\r\n\r\n### The wrappers API\r\n\r\nWith **SimpleForm** you can configure how your components will be rendered using the wrappers API.\r\nThe syntax looks like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.wrappers :tag => :div, :class => :input,\r\n                :error_class => :field_with_errors do |b|\r\n\r\n  # Form extensions\r\n  b.use :html5\r\n  b.optional :pattern\r\n  b.use :maxlength\r\n  b.use :placeholder\r\n  b.use :readonly\r\n\r\n  # Form components\r\n  b.use :label_input\r\n  b.use :hint,  :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :hint }\r\n  b.use :error, :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :error }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe _Form components_ will generate the form tags like labels, inputs, hints or errors contents. The available components are:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n:label         # The <label> tag alone\r\n:input         # The <input> tag alone\r\n:label_input   # The <label> and the <input> tags\r\n:hint          # The hint for the input\r\n:error         # The error for the input\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe _Form extensions_ are used to generate some attributes or perform some lookups on the model to\r\nadd extra information to your components.\r\n\r\nYou can create new _Form components_ using the wrappers API as in the following example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.wrappers do |b|\r\n  b.use :placeholder\r\n  b.use :label_input\r\n  b.wrapper :tag => :div, :class => 'separator' do |component|\r\n    component.use :hint,  :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :hint }\r\n    component.use :error, :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :error }\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis will wrap the hint and error components within a `div` tag using the class `'separator'`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to customize the custom _Form components_ on demand you can give it a name like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.wrappers do |b|\r\n  b.use :placeholder\r\n  b.use :label_input\r\n  b.wrapper :my_wrapper, :tag => :div, :class => 'separator' do |component|\r\n    component.use :hint,  :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :hint }\r\n    component.use :error, :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :error }\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nand now you can pass options to your `input` calls to customize the `:my_wrapper` _Form component_.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Completely turns off the custom wrapper\r\nf.input :name, :my_wrapper => false\r\n\r\n# Configure the html\r\nf.input :name, :my_wrapper_html => { :id => 'special_id' }\r\n\r\n# Configure the tag\r\nf.input :name, :my_wrapper_tag => :p\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also define more than one wrapper and pick one to render in a specific form or input.\r\nTo define another wrapper you have to give it a name, as the follow:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.wrappers :small do |b|\r\n  b.use :placeholder\r\n  b.use :label_input\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nand use it in this way:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Specifying to whole form\r\nsimple_form_for @user, :wrapper => :small do |f|\r\n  f.input :name\r\nend\r\n\r\n# Specifying to one input\r\nsimple_form_for @user do |f|\r\n  f.input :name, :wrapper => :small\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SimpleForm** also allows you to use optional elements. For instance, let's suppose you want to use\r\nhints or placeholders, but you don't want them to be generated automatically. You can set their\r\ndefault values to `false` or use the `optional` method. Is preferible to use the `optional` syntax:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.wrappers :placeholder => false do |b|\r\n  b.use :placeholder\r\n  b.use :label_input\r\n  b.wrapper :tag => :div, :class => 'separator' do |component|\r\n    component.optional :hint, :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :hint }\r\n    component.use :error, :wrap_with => { :tag => :span, :class => :error }\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy setting it as `optional`, a hint will only be generated when `:hint => true` is explicitly used.\r\nThe same for placehold.\r\n\r\n## HTML 5 Notice\r\n\r\nBy default, **SimpleForm** will generate input field types and attributes that are supported in HTML5,\r\nbut are considered invalid HTML for older document types such as HTML4 or XHTML1.0. The HTML5\r\nextensions include the new field types such as email, number, search, url, tel, and the new\r\nattributes such as required, autofocus, maxlength, min, max, step.\r\n\r\nMost browsers will not care, but some of the newer ones - in particular Chrome 10+ - use the\r\nrequired attribute to force a value into an input and will prevent form submission without it.\r\nDepending on the design of the application this may or may not be desired. In many cases it can\r\nbreak existing UI's.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to disable all HTML 5 extensions in **SimpleForm** with the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nSimpleForm.html5 = false # default is true\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to have all other HTML 5 features, such as the new field types, you can disable only\r\nthe browser validation:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nSimpleForm.browser_validations = false # default is true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis option adds a new `novalidate` property to the form, instructing it to skip all HTML 5\r\nvalidation. The inputs will still be generated with the required and other attributes, that might\r\nhelp you to use some generic javascript validation.\r\n\r\nYou can also add `novalidate` to a specific form by setting the option on the form itself:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= simple_form_for(resource, :html => {:novalidate => true}) do |form| %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease notice that any of the configurations above will disable the `placeholder` component,\r\nwhich is an HTML 5 feature. We believe most of the newest browsers are handling this attribute fine,\r\nand if they aren't, any plugin you use would take of using the placeholder attribute to do it.\r\nHowever, you can disable it if you want, by removing the placeholder component from the components\r\nlist in **SimpleForm** configuration file.\r\n\r\n## Information\r\n\r\n### Google Group\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, comments, or concerns please use the Google Group instead of the GitHub\r\nIssues tracker:\r\n\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/plataformatec-simpleform\r\n\r\n### RDocs\r\n\r\nYou can view the **SimpleForm** documentation in RDoc format here:\r\n\r\nhttp://rubydoc.info/github/plataformatec/simple_form/master/frames\r\n\r\nIf you need to use **SimpleForm** with Rails 2.3, you can always run `gem server` from the command line\r\nafter you install the gem to access the old documentation.\r\n\r\n### Bug reports\r\n\r\nIf you discover any bugs, feel free to create an issue on GitHub.
